//time complexity : O(log N)
//for efficiently inserting and deleting
//items are stored in an ordered manner
//all the elements on left side will be smaller than root node
//and all the elements on right will be greater
//cost efficient : ex- restructuring is not required after insertion or deletion because of dynamic memory allocation
